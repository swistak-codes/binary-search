# Binary search

Repository with code for [blog](https://swistak.codes) entry about binary search and other search methods in list structure. You can find whole article here: https://swistak.codes/wyszukiwanie-w-listach/

Comments are in Polish, since blog article is also in Polish.

## Apps

All of the apps require NodeJS (latest LTS) to be installed on your machine.

### number-guess

Simple number guessing game showing binary search capabilities. Can be checked here: https://codesandbox.io/s/number-guess-cl937

Running instructions:

```bash
cd ./number-guess
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

### binary-search-stats

App for generating CSVs with statistics about binary search. Runs in two modes â€” collecting how many comparisons is needed to find each number in a sequence or collecting average number of comparisons for different sizes of sets. Can be checked here: https://repl.it/@tswistak/binary-search-stats#index.js (index.js slightly modified to allow running from repl.it environment)

Running instructions:

```bash
cd ./binary-search-stats
npm install
npm run comparisons 0 100
npm run averages 5 10000
```

### interpolation-search-stats

App for generating CSVs with statistics about interpolation search. Runs similarly as binary-search-stats. However, here as an additional argument we're providing the name of number generator. Available ones are: oneToN, arithmetic, geometric, random, gaussian. Can be checked here: https://repl.it/@tswistak/interpolation-search-stats#index.js

Running instructions:

```bash
cd ./binary-search-stats
npm install
npm run comparisons oneToN
npm run comparisons arithmetic
npm run comparisons geometric
npm run comparisons random
npm run comparisons gaussian
```
